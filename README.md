# Hi! I'm Mitchel Rojas (michi) 👋

I’m a **Telematics Engineering** student at **Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María**, based in **Valparaíso, Chile**. I’m passionate about **cybersecurity**, **software development**, and the **Linux world**.

---

With over **1 year of experience in embedded systems and IoT**, I’ve worked with platforms like **ESP32**, **Arduino**, and **Raspberry Pi**. I'm proficient in **C**, **C++**, **C#**, and **Python**, and I’m always diving deeper into **IoT**, **cybersecurity**, and **operating systems**.

I’m constantly learning and building, and my goal is to contribute to the **open-source community** with useful projects that can help others and inspire new ideas. I aim to build things that others can learn from and improve upon, and in the long term, I want to focus on **research** and **development** in my field through further studies.

I believe in the power of **open-source** to drive innovation and foster collaboration. My focus is on creating tools, sharing knowledge, and learning from others along the way. If you're working on an open-source project or just looking for inspiration, feel free to check out my work!

Let’s build something impactful together and keep pushing the boundaries of technology. 💻
